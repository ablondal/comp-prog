# Ari's Codebook

This is my own codebook and code repository for ACM-ICPC contests.
It includes code from all over, as well as some of my own custom code.
It tries to keep code generic enough to cover most use cases.
Headers of code will usually denote where the code came from.

Anyone has permission to use this codebook :D.

# How to compile
I am using the wonderful tool "codes2pdf".
To install it, please visit https://github.com/erfaniaa/codes2pdf and follow the .README instructions.

# How to use the code
Copy-paste it, or type it out, or whatever!
